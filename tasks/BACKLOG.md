- Title: Investigate Angular 21 Vite dev server routing bug
- Status: todo

Angular 21's Vite-based dev server (`ng serve` in development mode) has a bug where the Router's `ROUTES` multi-provider is not populated — `router.config` is an empty array at runtime, causing no route components to render. The production build and `ng serve --configuration production` both work correctly. This is an Angular 21 / Vite dev server regression, not a project configuration issue.

Current workaround: e2e tests use `ng serve --configuration production` in `playwright.config.ts`.

Acceptance criteria:
- [ ] Root cause identified (Angular issue tracker link if available)
- [ ] Determine if this is a known Angular 21 bug or a project config issue
- [ ] If fixable: apply fix and update playwright.config.ts to use plain `ng serve`
- [ ] If not fixable: document the workaround and link to the upstream issue
